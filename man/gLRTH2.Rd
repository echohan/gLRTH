\title{The Function for the Likelihood Ratio Test for Genome-Wide Association under Genetic Heterogeneity with long format of genotype and disease status data}
\usage{
gLRTH2(g, d)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{an n x 1 vector contains the number of minor allele (i.e., 0, 1 or 2) for a given SNP, where n is the number of observations.}

\item{d}{an n x 1 vector contains disease status, 1 is case and 0 is control, where n is the number of observations.}
}
\value{
The test statistic and asymptotic p-value for the likelihood ratio test under genetic heterogeneity
